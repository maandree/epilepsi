***  Coding style for Java and C ***


* Indention and curly brackets *

Indention is 4 characters; if possible you must uses blank
spaces and not tabs spaces. This is default in GNU Emacs.

Curly brackets are only used syntax requires it, when the all
other alternatives in an if-statement with many alternatives
have it, and as stand alone blocks (without if, while or alike)
is used for clarity, or when switch cases whould otherwise have
variable name conflictions.

One line if:s, while:s, do..while:s and for:s does not use curly
brackets. This is also applied when the only instructions is a
block (another if, while or alike).

Curly brackets are put on seperate lines, but if it is for, and
only for, a method, an if, a for (including enhanced for) or a
while (excluding do..while), the open curly brackets are put, iff
it improves readability, on the same line has the first statement;
we will call this compressed bracket use. The interior of the
block must be at most four instructions with no blank lines. main
and constructors does not qualify as methods in this case.

Multiplie if:s or, but not and, multiple else if:s you that have
to must two instructions, the if:s and else if:s should be put on
one compressed line each, with two spaces between, heads curly
brackets and instructions, in a tabular view. This include the
else part iff there is only one if.

This is how compressed bracket use look:

        public void doWait()
	{   synchronized (this.monitor)
	    {   this.monitor.wait();
	}   }

Notice, which was not mentioned, that the closing brackets, in
compressed bracket use, are put on the same line if possible.



* The do..while:s *

The while in a do..while is put on a separate line with two
extra spaces in the indention.

        do			do  ....
        {			  while
            ....
        }
          while (...);



* else if:s *

else if are normally handled as one keyword with exactly one
space between else and if, but if it feels logical the if is
handled as the interior of the else, and put on the next line
with one more indention.



* switch:es *

The case:s in swiches are indented, and their interior is
further indented. The default is put in the end and just
another case. Fall throughs must be commented with

        //FALL THROUGH

A blank line, or the end if the switch, must be put after
the break in the end of a case.



* forever:s *

forever is repsented by for(;;), not by while (true).



* final:s *

All unexchangeable variables must be final, this includes
all method and constructor parameters.



* Element order *

The following are the order body elements, they are
separated by three lines. Only one non-enclosed class,
enum, interface or annotation may be put in one file.

∙ Enum vales

        Each end with a comma, and subclassing is not encuraged.
	If the enum has more then just values, a semicolon is
	used instead of the lasts values enum, in the same place.

∙ Constants, in accessibility order (static final)

    	Constants have one blank line between them, and can
	be groups; groups have two blank lined between them.
	Value setting help variables are put in beginning of
	the groups.

∙ Type initialisers

        The documentation for these must have
    
		Type initialiser
    
	as the first paragraph.
    	You may have multiple type initialisers.

∙ Constructors

	The documentation for these must have
    
		Constructor
    
	as the first paragraph.
    
	If you rather keep the default constructor you must
	have the comment

    	        //Has default constructor

	in the contructors place.
    
	If class uses a private default constructor instead
	of the public default constructor, the constructor
    
		/**
        	 * Constructor
        	 */
		private ClassName()
        	{
        	    //Privatise default contructor
       		}

	is added. If the class does not have instances
	the constructor
    	
		/**
		 * Non-constructor
		 */
		private ClassName()
		{
		    assert false : "You may not create instances of this class [ClassName].";
		}
	
	is added.
    
∙ Singleton/multiton implemenetation: constructor, getInstance, instance/instance map.

∙ Initialisers

	The documentation for these must have
    
		Initialiser
    
	as the first paragraph.
	You may have multiple initialisers.

∙ Main method
     
        public static void main(final String... args)

∙ Other static variables

∙ Non-static variables

        Only final variables may be public.

∙ Static methods

∙ Non-static methods

∙ Inner classes, enums, interfaces

        Annotations should be in sperate files.

∙ Getters and settes

∙ Static methods

∙ Non-static methods

∙ Main method for tests
     
        public static void main(final String... args)

∙ Everthing above with the same layout, but is used only for tests.



* final:s and try:s *

This mostly conserns final variables that are assinged in try-blocks,
but can be used anywhere.

Lets say you have a final variable namned 'marble', and you want to
assign it in a try-block, and assign null, or something else, to it
if you try fails. You will need another, help, variable, that is not
final, in this case we name that variable '_marble', i.e. as the
final variable, but with an prepending underscore.

For example if we want to know which files in the stdout file, we
use the code blocked below:
    	
    	final String stdout;
	String _stdout;
	try
	{
	    _stdout = (new File("/dev/stdout")).getCanonicalPath();
	}
	catch (final IOException err)
	{
	    _stdout = null;
	}
	stdout = _stdout;



* new:s, cast:s and in-line assignments *

As seen in the previous section, anonymous objects are encapsulated
in round brackets. With anonymous objects we mean objects that
are created but not stored in a variable.

This encapsulation is used for clarity for the exact same reason,
but more importantly, casts are also encapsulated in round brackets,
if an element is used without storing the cast.

The two code patterns described above is still used if the object
or cast is assigned inline, inside round brackets.
For example if use the code in the previous section, but also
wants to store the File object for "/dev/stdout", we use this code:
    	
    	final String stdout;
	String _stdout;
	File file = null;
	try
	{
	    _stdout = (file = new File("/dev/stdout")).getCanonicalPath();
	}
	catch (final IOException err)
	{
	    _stdout = null;
	}
	stdout = _stdout;



* Connectives *

If the order of the operands is fatal, but it does not have to do
with null or boundary check, or is not otherwise clearly visible
in the same statement; the statements line, must end with:

         //Order is important

Precedence rank of connectives should be assumed unkown. That is,
operands including operands, such as = or another connective
[that is &, &&, |, || or ^], must be encapsulated in round brackets.

The fact that ('a' <= c && c <= 'z' || 'A' <= c && c <= 'Z') is
parsed as ((('a' <= c) && (c <= 'z')) || (('A' <= c) && (c <= 'Z')))
should be ignored, and the later (full use of brackets) should
always be used.

The NOT connective should be used with care, there are several
alternatives (including the NOT connective), here is an guildline,
the higher up, the more likely to be the syntax of choice:
	
	∙ ((a != b) || (c != d))
	
	∙ (((a == b) && (c == d)) == false)
	
	∙ (false == ((a == b) && (c == d)))
	
	∙ (((a == b) && (c == d)) ^ true)
	
	∙ (true ^ ((a == b) && (c == d)))

	∙ !((a == b) && (c == d))
	
	∙ (((a == b) && (c == d)) != true)
	
	∙ (true != ((a == b) && (c == d)))



* Events and errors *

Event parameters, such is the listener for GUI:s, should be named 'e'
iff it is the only parameter.

Exception parameters (in catch:es) should be named 'err', if it is
in used by an outer catch, 'ierr' should be used instead, in 'jerr'
if 'ierr' is also used.

These four names are only allowed in this cases.



* Compact switch:es *

switch:es containing six or more simple cases (one alternatice), no
multichoice cases and optionally a default, may be compact. It should
be compact iff each case has one somewhat short instruction followed
by break or return, or neither. But that ending must be the same for
all. It is however possible to have groups of six, where the groups
can have different endings relative to eachother. If the cases in a
group does not have break or return, the group can end with break or
return, this is ended on a line directly after the cases.
Each case is written on one line, and the cases does not have, blank
lines between them.
default is written as normally.



* import:s and package:s *

Order:

        ∙ [Copyright notice]
	∙ package
	∙ import from program packages
	∙ (one blank line)
	∙ import static from program packages
	∙ (one blank line)
	∙ import from library packages
	∙ (one blank line)
	∙ import from Java native packages
	∙ (one blank line)
	∙ import static from library packages
	∙ (one blank line)
	∙ import static from Java native packages
	∙ (two blank line)
	∙ [class documentation]

Wildcard imports should be used when possible, but is optional
if up to two classes is import from one Java native package or
library package. But for static imports wildcard should only
be used if there are many static imports.

Library packages are group by library with one blank line between
them. javax packages are imported before java packages, but without
seperative blank lines.

If a class is imported explicitly due to ambiguity it should end
with the comment:

        //Explicity



* Documentation *

{@inheritDoc} should be used if you have nothing good to say,
and the method is inherited from an interface or a superclass.

{@link} is used when referring to classes, method or variables,
keep in mind that $ referes to a subclass and # referes to a
variable or method dot (.) is not used in these cases.

Use HTML 5 (or XHTML), instead of the SGML based HTML 4.

Literals are refered to by <code>literal</code>.

<tt>X</code> referes to the parameter X.

Use @throws, and not @exception, for exceptions.

@param and @throws should be followed by atleast two spaces,
followed by the parameters name or the exceptions classname,
followed by atleast two spaces.
@return, @version, @since and @author is followe to at least
two spaces.
These should be written in a tabular manner, and @param and
@return is grouped together, @since and @version are groups.
@author and @throws are only grouped with themself. (@author
is not grouped with @throws.) One blank line is used between
groups.
These items are written in the following order:

        ∙ @param
        ∙ @return

        ∙ @throws

        ∙ @author

        ∙ @since
        ∙ @version

All named classes, enums, interfaces and annotations should
contain @author so everyone knows who to ask for help.

@author has the syntax:

        @author  SPOKEN_NAME [MIDDLE_NAME] LAST_NAME, <a href="mailto:E_MAIL_ADDRESS">E_MAIL_ADDRESS</a>

Note that countries have differing name laws. SPOKEN_NAME
refers the single name you are normally called, that is given.
MIDDLE_NAME does NOT in for example Richard M. Stallman
refer to Matthew, he has, by this convention, no middle name.
A middle name is a name inherited from one of your parents
(or ancestor) will LAST_NAME is the other one, the primary one.
The M. in Richard M. Stallman is a first name, but also second
name, and is not printed in our convention for @author,
the a-tag for the e-mail address makes it long enough;
MIDDLE_NAME is optional, us it only if you are regulary called
by that name.
